Deluge's Thin Client is a great way to manage your Deluge instance from your PC. It also gives you more customization to your Deluge instance and some plug-ins, such as LabelPlus, do require that you need to have the thin client installed for you to access its settings.

This guide shows you how to install, configure and to connect your Deluge client to your slot's instance.
