| Field       | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|:-------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Username    | Desired Username for user                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Password    | Desired Password for user                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Scope       | This is an important option as this will be the folder the user may access. In this example, it is set to `./share` which is `/home1/username/share` Note: It is not recommended to point this directly to a rclone mount as this will cause extreme IO and possibly cause issues with your slot |
| Permissions | You can set the kind of actions a user can perform, for example, you may want to allow download but never allow upload so that a user can not deposit files onto your slot. Youâ€™d untick create Files and Directories                                                                                       |
