In this guide, we'll be setting up TheLounge for the first time and explaining its use.

-   Modern features brought to IRC. Push notifications, link previews, new
    message markers, and more bring IRC to the 21st century.

-   Always connected. Remains connected to IRC servers while you are offline.

-   Cross platform. It doesn't matter what OS you use, it just works wherever
    Node.js runs.

-   Responsive interface. The client works smoothly on every desktop, smartphone
    and tablet.

-   Synchronized experience. Always resume where you left off no matter what
    device.

In private mode, The Lounge acts like a bouncer and a client combined, in order
to offer an experience similar to other modern chat applications outside the IRC
world. Users can then access and resume their session without being disconnected
from their channels.

In public mode, it acts as an open chat available to anyone without
registration. ` Absolutely do not enable public mode on your installation.`

After your first login using the credentials set during installation, You will
be presented with the setup for your first IRC server connection
