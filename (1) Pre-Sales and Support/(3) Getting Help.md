Here we list the various ways of getting support from Ultraseedbox!

***

## UltraSeedbox Docs

## Community Discord Support

We offer a community-powered support Discord server. While staff may sometimes be available here, it is not an official line of support and as a result we cannot guarantee support through the server.

Please keep in mind our Discord support is primarily community-driven. As such please be patient with whoever helps you. If you are requiring more sensitive or immediate support, try submitting a ticket.

[Our community Discord server can be found at this link.](https://discord.com/invite/YXGYS9D)

## Submitting a Ticket

If you have searched our Docs for information to assist with your issue and was unable to get the problem solved, feel free to reach out to us via a ticket!
